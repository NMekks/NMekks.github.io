                <p>
                Hello, I am Le Spodsay! I am a 23 year old computer engineering student 
                based in Istanbul, Turkey.
                <br />My journey as an artist began when I was 2 years old
                the day my pre-school teacher passed out a drawing journal, and I've been drawing ever since.
                I draw inspiration from the many things I consume such as anime, manga, video games,
                and other media. It is my dream to get into game development, to build my own games,
                from basic mechanisms and game levels to character design and publishing. In the mean time,
                I will continue to make art that is both beautiful and fulfilling.

                </p>
